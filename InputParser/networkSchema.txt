This document describes how the input XML file should be formatted to
create the network used in the simulator.

The XML structure of the network is one large Network object.

The Network contains the following fields: snapshotTime,
routingTableUpdateTime, networkHosts, networkRouters, networkLinks,
and networkFlows.

snapshotTime is the time interval between collecting stats on the network
activity, such as link buffer occupancy. It should be an integer number
of milliseconds. This must be specified.

routingTableUpdateTime is the time interval between updating the routing
tables of the network. It should be an integer number of milliseconds.
This must be specified.

networkHosts is a vector of the hosts in the network. It has a host
element that can be specified multiple times. The host element has
one attribute, "id", which should be an integer identifying that
host. The ids must be specified and should be distinct,
or an error will be given. networkHosts must be specified. The simulator
will run without giving it any hosts, but it will not be able to do
anything.

networkRouters is a vector of the routers in the network. It has a
router element that can be specified multiple times. The router element
has one attibute, "id", which must be specified and behaves exactly like
the id of the host element above. networkRouters must be specified.
The simulator will run without giving it any routers, but it will not
be able to do anything.

networkLinks is a vector of the links in the network. It has a link element
that can be specified multiple times. 
Each link has an id. The id is the same as those of hosts and routers. 
The link element also has 5 elements in it: linkRate, linkDelay,
bufferSize, node1, and node2. Each of these elements must be specified.
linkRate is the rate the link can process
data in Mbps. linkDelay is the propagation delay of this link in
milliseconds. bufferSize is the size of the link's buffer in KB.
node1 is one end of the link and has one attribute,
"type", which is 0 for host and 1 for router.
The value of node1 is the id of the node, which should be one of the
appropriate nodes as determined by type. If not, an error will occur.
node2 is the other end of the link and is structured the same as link1.
networkLinks must be specified. The simulator will run without giving
it any links, but it will not be able to do anything.

networkFlows is a vector of the flows in the network. It has a flow element
that can be specified multiple time. The flow element has 1 attribute
"id", which is the same as that of hosts, routers, and flows. The flow
element also has 5 elements: source, destination, flowSize,
flowSartTime, and congestionAlgorithmType. Each of these elements must be
specified. source is the id of the source host of the flow. It must
be one of the hosts given in networkHosts. destination is the destination
host of the flow. It must be one of the hosts given in networkHosts.
flowSize is a double the size of the flow in MB. Furthermore, we assume that
each host has at most one outgoing flow, as TA said. flowStartTime is
a double the number of seconds after starting the simulation to begin
sending packets for the flow. congestionAlgorithmType is an enum
defining which congestion control algorithm to use for this flow. The
options are "reno" and "vegas". networkFlows must be specified. The
simulator will run without giving it any flows, but it will not
do anything (number of flows is the stopping condition of the simulation).
Additionally, the network is not guaranteed to have paths that will go from
the source host to the destination host. There is no checking to make sure
that there is such a path, and so if this is the case, all the flows will
be created still. The simulation assumes that the initial routing table update
will finish and contain all the hosts and routers in the network before any
flows begin. If this is not the case, there will be some hosts and routers
that will not be present in some routing tables. The behavior of our network
is that if the destination node is not present in the routing table, an
error message is printed and the flow is stopped immediately. Thus, if
a flow starts too early (so that its destination host does not appear in
routing tables) or does not have a path to follow, the network will drop this
flow and continue.

Each network host, link, and flow has a "print" attribute that determines
whether or not it will be included in the output graphs. In addition, the
networkHosts, networkLinks, and networkFlows elements have a "separateGraphs"
attribute that determines whether or not each host / link / flow should be
graphed on the same graph or separately. "0" indicates that they should be
graphed together, while "1" indicates that they should be graphed separately.

So, the input XML file to use for the network simulator can look something
like the following.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>

    </networkRouters>
    <networkLinks>
        <link id="0" print="0">

            <node1 type="0">1</node1>
