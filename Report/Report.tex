\section{Introduction}
Networking theory is an important part to the function of the Internet. Congestion control algorithms can heavily influence the speed of a connection. 

In this paper, we describe the implementation of a network simulator including its architecture and design choices. We also include graphs of this simulator as run on a series of test cases. Lastly, we give a mathematical analysis for one of the congestion algorithms, as applied to one of the cases.

\section{Simulator Description}
    Our network simulator is written in C++. 
    
    The network consists of several different types of network classes as well as a Controller to monitor the simulation. 
    
    We use event-based simulation, with a global event queue, to advance actions in our program. 
    
    For input, we take an XML file as input and use the pugixml C++ XML parser to read the file and create necessary network objects. The program uses these objects to simulate the network until all the flows finish. 
    
    The congestion control algorithms we implemented were TCP Reno and TCP Vegas.

     As the simulation runs, we collect various statistics. At the end of the simulation, we use gnuplot to create figures based off of collected data.

\subsection{Design Decisions}
    We chose to write the simulator in C++ for several reasons. C++ is a powerful and fast object oriented programming language which suited our architecture plan well. We wrote classes for different network objects (Link, Flow, etc.) as well as simulation objects (Controller, CongestionAlgorithm, etc.). By using C++’s inheritance, we were able to group objects with similar behavior (ex. Host and Router) and create abstraction hierarchies (ex. Node, Packet).  C++ allowed for writing these classes with encapsulation.

    Because the network that we are simulating is based on discrete events, we chose to use event-based simulation. Continuous simulation did not make sense as it would be very CPU heavy and take a longer time to run on our computers. Because we knew that we would be spending a fair amount of time running code, we figured that event-based simulation would be the most efficient.

    We chose the pugixml parser because it is lightweight and has a simple, open-source library. The lightweightness was particularly attractive because we did not want the simulator to be spending most of its runtime parsing input files. Furthermore, the pugixml library was easy to use. XML was the chosen input format because as a universally recognized format it was easy to make it fit our desired system parameters. Thus, we ended up using an XML DOM type input, as it could easily describe the objects we wanted for the simulation.

    We chose two TCP congestion control algorithms: TCP Reno and TCP Vegas. We wanted to choose one loss-based congestion control algorithm (Reno) and one delay-based congestion control algorithm (Vegas). We chose Reno because among the loss-based control algorithms (Reno and Tahoe) because it included more advanced congestion control through the use of fast\_recover. Further equations for the analysis are in the notes. Obviously, this section needs some work/deleting.
    Maybe a paragraph on why we chose gnuplot.
