* Talk about the project process and division of
labor. What worked well? What would you have done
differently?

WORKFLOW


weekly meetings  in person
debugin in person
more productive when together and talking about stuff rather than separately

not so well
focusing too much on one aspect at a time
tendency to not test code
    not sure if things worked
thanksgiving killed us

dol
even for the most part
better deadlines

version control
lots of merge conflicts
no branches
useful for backtracking
problematic as new git users

small group -> didnâ€™t benefit as much from ticketing/issue tracking
