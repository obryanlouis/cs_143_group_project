WORKFLOW


	Some of the things that helped us the most were meeting together and debugging in person. More people thinking about the same thing helped things to get done more quickly. On the other hand, there were times that we focused too intensely on one idea when it would have been more useful to work in parallel on different items.

	We also would have benefited from prior knowledge of version control since it was essential to the project. Because we decided to use one branch to keep things simple, we ended up with several merge conflicts that might have been resolved by branching, or just more knowledge in general about GIT.

	It would have also been helpful to have better deadlines because there were a couple of weeks where progress was slow, and that really caught up to us as the project came to the end.
